Nearly everyone has been bitten or stung by an insect at one time or another. Whether you’ve been attacked by a mosquito, fly, bee, wasp, ant, or other bug, insect bites and stings usually cause a mild reaction. Your body reacts to venom or other proteins that insects inject into you or transfer to your body through their saliva. This can result in symptoms at the site of the bite or sting, such as:\n
\n
   redness\n
   swelling\n
   pain\n
   itching\n
The severity of your symptoms can vary, depending on the type of insect that bites or stings you. Some people also develop a severe allergic reaction to insect stings or bites. Bee and wasp allergies are particularly common. A severe allergic reaction can cause:\n
\n
  hives\n
  abdominal cramps\n
  nausea and vomiting\n
  swelling of your face, lips, or throat\n
  breathing problems\n
  shock\n
\n
  Spiders\n\n
Most spider bites are relatively harmless. Anywhere from several hours to a day after you get bitten, you may notice symptoms similar to those of an insect sting or bite. At the site of the bite, you may experience:\n
\n
redness\n
swelling\n
pain\n
itching\n
Some types of spiders can cause more serious reactions, including black widow and brown recluse spiders. If you know what to look for, it’s easy to identify both of these species.\n
\n
Fully grown black widow spiders are about 1/2-inch long. They have a black body with a red hourglass marking on the underside of their abdomen. Some black widow spiders also have red spots on the upper surface of their abdomen and crosswise red bars on the underside.
\n
Black widow spider venom causes problems with your nervous system. Within a few hours of being bitten, you may notice intense pain at the site of the bite. You may also experience other symptoms, such as chills, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
\n
Fully grown brown recluse spiders are larger than black widow spiders. They’re about 1 inch in length. They vary in color from yellowish tan to dark brown. They have a violin-shaped marking on the surface of their upper body, with the base of the violin facing toward their head and the neck of the violin pointing toward their rear.
\n
Brown recluse spider bites cause damage to your skin. Within about eight hours of being bitten, you will experience redness and intense pain at the site of the bite. Over time, a blister will develop. When the blister breaks down, it will leave a deep ulcer in your skin, which can become infected. You also may develop symptoms such as fever, rash, and nausea.

\n
If the insect’s stinger is still embedded in their skin, remove it by gently scraping a flat-edged object, such as a credit card, across their skin. Avoid using tweezers to remove the stinger, since squeezing it may release more venom.\n
Wash the area of the bite with soap and water.\n
Place a cold compress or ice pack on the area for about 10 minutes at a time to help reduce pain and swelling. Wrap any ice or ice packs in a clean cloth to protect their skin.\n
Apply calamine lotion or a paste of baking soda and water to the area several times a day to help relieve itching and pain. Calamine lotion is a type of antihistamine cream.\n" />
